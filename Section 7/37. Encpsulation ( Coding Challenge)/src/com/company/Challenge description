Coding Exercise 38

Create a class named Printer, giving it two variables of type int: tonerLevel and pagesPrinted, and one type boolean named duplex. All three fields will have
private access. The associated constructor will accept two of these variables: tonerLevel and duplex, and will have rules:

· tonerLevel must be greater than -1 but less than or equal to 100. If it does not meet these condition, then is should be initialized to -1.

· duplex should be initialized to the value of the parameter.

In addition, pagesPrinted should be initialized to 0.

Three other methods need to be defined as:

1. addToner will accept one parameter, tonerAmount, type int. First, tonerAmount should be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. If this condition is met
a second test must be included to test whether tonerLevel plus tonerAmount is greater than 100. If so, the method should return -1. If not, then tonerLevel should
have the incoming tonerAmount added to it and the new tonerLevel should then be returned by the method. Also if the initial condition test fails, then the method
should return -1.

2. Method printPages will accept one parameter, pages of type int. A variable called pagesToPrint should be created and initialized to the value of the incoming
parameter. A conditional check should be performed on whether the Printer class field duplex is “true” or “false”. If “true” then a calculation most be performed
to determine the number of pages (sheets of paper) needed to print the job double sided. The pagesToPrint value is then added to the class field pagesPrinted,
but the value of pagesToPrint should be returned by the method.

3. Method getPagesPrinted has no parameters and merely returns the values of the member variable pagesPrinted.

Example input:

1  Printer printer = new Printer(50, true);

2  System.out.println(printer.addToner(50));

3  System.out.println("initial page count = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());

4   int pagesPrinted = printer.printPages(4);

5  System.out.println("Pages printed was " + pagesPrinted +" new total print count for printer = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());

6  pagesPrinted = printer.printPages(2);

7  System.out.println("Pages printed was " + pagesPrinted +" new total print count for printer = " +printer.getPagesPrinted());


Example output:

100

initial page count = 0

Printing in duplex mode

Pages printed was 2 new total print count for printer = 2

Printing in duplex mode

Pages printed was 1 new total print count for printer = 3


Tips:

1. Remember to only paste the code from Printer class into the exercise evaluator.  The Main class does not need to be pasted in.

2. You can include a message in the printPages method which informs the user that the printer is printing in duplex mode if duplex is set to “true” if you want.

3. When calculating pagesToPrint if duplexer is “true”, remember that there are two operators which can help with this.  The division operator   “ / ” divides a
number and returns only the quotient without any remainder and the modulo “ % ” operator divides the number and only returns the remainder, whether 0 or otherwise.
